## 8 Week SQL Challenge
Case study questions and answers/solutions for #8WeekSQLChallenge by Danny Ma

This repository contains all of my SQL submissions for the #8WeekSQLChallenge created by Danny Ma.

In the summer of 2022 I completed Danny's Challenge and I found it to be the best SQL exercises found on the web. Many times I had to review other peoples work to figure out how to exactly get the correct answers. This challenge pushes you beyond basic SQL and into intermediate/advance SQL techniques.

This year (September 2023) I decided to revisit the challenge to brush up on my SQL and to fix errors, finish incomplete sections and refactor some of my SQL code as I have learned more efficient/effective methods of getting the correct answer. I will attempt to comment the code as much as necessary in order to help others who may be struggling with some of the questions.

I would also like to acknowledge the GitHub repos that were essential in helping me learn to how appoach the problems and find more efficient and effective solutions. If you are are considering taking Danny Ma's Serious SQL, I cannot recommend it enough.

## All solutions were coded using the MYSQL.
